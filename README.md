# Cruise App
I want to create a post getaway purchase webiste where the customer gets more infomation on the trip they're taking.

[WireFrame](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOF2DWUQ=/?invite_link_id=211244539048)

It will show the weather of the places they're going and relevant cultural things.
This page will include a login and signup allowing the purchaser to comment and see comments.

## MVP
- Get the website running
- Login page at the beginning
- Comments

## Stretch Plan
- Alot of css work
